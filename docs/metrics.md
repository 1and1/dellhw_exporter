## What do the metrics mean?

Most metrics returned besides temperature, volts, fans RPM count and others, are state indicators which can have the following of the four states:

* `0` - `OK`, the component should be fine.
* `1` - `Critical`, the component is not okay / has potentially failed / `Unknown` status.
* `2` - `Non-Critical`, the component is not okay, but not critical.
